            <p style="line-height: 15px;">2010, Farmer released her eighth studio album, Bleu noir. 
            The album marked Farmer's return to the dark synth-pop and Europop production of her first albums. 
            The lead single, "Oui mais... non", sold over 130,000 copies in France.  
            In 2015, Farmer's tenth studio album, Interstellaires, debuted at number one in France; 
            the album was preceded by the lead single "Stolen Car", a duet with Sting, which reached the number one position 
            on the French singles chart in September 2015. 
            Her eleventh studio album, Désobéissance, was released in 2018, debuting at number one and selling over 265.000 copies.</p>
            
            <p style="line-height: 15px;"> In addition to her music career, Farmer also worked as a lyricist for French singer Alizée,  
            while also being responsible for her image and public appearances. Her debut single, "Moi... Lolita", co-written by Farmer,  
            reached number one in several countries in Europe, and peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart in February 2002. 
            Farmer made her film debut in 1994, starring in Giorgino, and in 2018, she starred in the English-language horror film Ghostland.</p>

            <p style="line-height: 15px;"> Musically, Farmer is usually described as a pop and French pop artist; 
             nevertheless, she is known for reinventing her style with every album cycle.  
             All her albums between 1984 and 2008 were produced by her collaborator, Laurent Boutonnat.  
             Her first albums, Cendres de lune, Ainsi soit je... and L'autre... feature dark synth-pop and new wave instrumentation.  
             1995 saw the release of Anamorphosée, which features more simplistic lyrics and pop rock-influenced music. 
            Innamoramento and Avant que l'ombre... are often described as merging acoustic instruments with electronic beats. 
            Farmer then experimented with electronica and club music on 2008's Point de suture.  
            In 2010, Farmer released her first album without Laurent Boutonnat, Bleu noir, featuring songs produced by RedOne, 
            Moby and British alternative band Archive. The album saw Farmer return to the darker synth-pop and Europop production   
            of her debut album. For 2012's Monkey Me, Farmer collaborated with Boutonnat in the studio one more time. Interstellaires,  
            the singer's tenth studio album shows influences of pop rock and adult contemporary styles,  
            produced by French DJ The Avener and Martin Kierszenbaum.  On Désobéissance, 
            Farmer collaborated with French DJ Feder, American singer-songwriter LP and American producer Mike Del Rio,  
            marking a return to electronic dance music. For L'Emprise, Farmer collaborated with Woodkid to produce a "confidant,  
            and very intimate" album which offers a mix of symphonic music, industrial rhythms, and electropop. 
            Moby, AaRON, and Archive also contributed to the album.</p>
